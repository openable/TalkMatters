### Host: Hoseock

### Meeting Minutes
* Decide who will be "regular host" - Hoseock, Yongil, Sunny, BigEye
* We will try to get more regular host until next week
* BigEye and Sunny, Yongil will join as Regular Host of Season 4
* Nare needs more time to think about joining as regular host.
* Yongil - What will happen if I can not show up on time of the show as host?
  * Hoseock - as we all know, in Toastmasters, we never blame anyone who say they can't make to come to the meeting if they have certain reason. I think it's same here, as long as I am doing Talk Matters, I think I can backup or others will support you, just like toastmasters. So don't worry about it.
* Nare - How do we get reporters or session masters before the show date? 
  * Hoseock - The host of the week before can support mainly but if the host want something different than original format, then they need to coordinate before the meeting with other hosts
* Nare - It's hard to think about new format as host.
  * Hoseock - It's ok to adjust the format and contents of the show if host want but, it's also good to keep original format.
* Sunny - it will be good if guests and participants can have more chances to talk about their opinion
  * Dom - there is panel discussion that can gives more opportunity to the people who participate by the coordination of the host
